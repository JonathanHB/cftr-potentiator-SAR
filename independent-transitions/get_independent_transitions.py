#                                        MACROSTATE TRANSITION ANALYSIS
#          determine the number of independent transitions between macrostates in a westpa simulation

import numpy as np
import h5py

# ------------------------
# Parameters:
# h5path: path to the input west.h5 file
# pc_2_macrostate: function which takes a progress coordinate as its sole required argument
#                  and returns an integer in the range [0,n_macrostates) indicating which
#                  macrostate the walker is in, with -1 indicating no macrostate
# n_macrostates: number of macrostates in the system
# minround: first round of the h5 file to use. values other than 0 not currently supported
# maxround: last round of the h5 file to use. -1 means to use all rounds
# allcomplete: False means not to use the last round in the h5 file because that file
#              contains data for only some walkers from an incomplete westpa round
# ------------------------
# Returns:
# transitions: westpa rounds and walker numbers of walkers which have reached each macrostate from each other macrostate
#              If a walker leaves one macrostate and splits, and multiple of its offspring reach a second macrostate,
#              only the first of these offspring to reach the second state is recorded
#              (treating lower walker number as earlier within each westpa round)
